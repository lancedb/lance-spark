# Contributing to Spark Lance Connector

The Spark Lance connector codebase is at [lancedb/lance-spark](https://github.com/lancedb/lance-spark).

## Build Commands

This connector is built using Maven. You can run the following make commands:

```shell
# Build all
make build

# Clean all
make clean

# Build Spark 3.5 Scala 2.12
make build-35-212

# Clean build of Spark 3.5 Scala 2.12
make clean-35-212

# Build the runtime bundle of Spark 3.5 Scala 2.12
make bundle-35-212
```

## Styling Guide

We use checkstyle and spotless to lint the code.

All the `make build` commands automatically perform `spotless:apply` to the code.

To verify style, run:

```shell
make lint
```

## Documentation

### Setup

The documentation website is built using [mkdocs-material](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-material).
The build system require [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

Start the server with:

```shell
make serve-docs
```

### Understanding the Build Process

The contents in `lance-spark/docs` are for the ease of contributors to edit and preview.
After code merge, the contents are added to the 
[main Lance documentation](https://github.com/lancedb/lance/tree/main/docs) 
during the Lance doc CI build time, and is presented in the Lance website under 
[Apache Spark integration](https://lancedb.github.io/lance/integrations/spark).

The CONTRIBUTING.md document is auto-built to the [Lance Contributing Guide](https://lancedb.github.io/lance/community/contributing/)
